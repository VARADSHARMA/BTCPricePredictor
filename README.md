Bitcoin is a form of decentralized cryptocurrency which can be used for transaction without need for 
intermediaries using the peer-to-peer bitcoin network. These transactions are verified by network nodes 
through cryptography and then recorded in a public distributed ledger called blockchain. These Bitcoins 
are generated by the process of mining. Bitcoin is often said to be very volatile in nature. Volatility in 
finance is the degree of variations of trading price series over time, usually measured by standard 
deviation or logarithmic returns. The price of bitcoin has been through cycles of appreciations and 
depreciations over its lifetime, often referred to as bubble. Bitcoin is said to be more than 7 times more 
volatile than gold, 18 times more volatile than USD, which is the globally accepted currency for 
international trade. This volatility has often put traders and investors at a distance from bitcoin who 
donâ€™t want to risk a large sum of money. To solve this issue of volatility and predict the future prices 
of bitcoin, this aims to build machine learning and deep learning models in order to predict future prices 
of bitcoin to the highest possible degree of accuracy.
